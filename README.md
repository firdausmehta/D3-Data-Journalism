## Data Journalism and D3

## Background
* I have been tasked with analysing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings. I have used the data set from the US Census to investigate rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state, to build a scatterplot.
* The dataset: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
* The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Key Skills
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* D3.js interactive visualization
* tooltips

## Summary
* Before attempting to plot, I loaded in the CSV and did a `console.log` to make sure I correctly loaded the CSV
* Next, I made sure that my margins were appropriate so that I can properly do a scatterplot
* Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty and Smokers vs. Age.
* I used D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. The code for this graphic is in the app.js.
